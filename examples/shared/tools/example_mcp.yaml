# Example MCP Tool Configuration
#
# MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools connect to external servers that expose
# tools dynamically. Unlike CLI tools which define schema/recipes in YAML,
# MCP tools discover their capabilities at runtime from the server.
#
# Two transports are supported:
#   - stdio: Server runs as subprocess, communicates via stdin/stdout
#   - sse: Server runs remotely, communicates via Server-Sent Events
#
# Usage in agent code:
#   tools.list()                              # Discover available tools
#   tools.search("my-mcp")                    # Find tools by name/description
#   tools.my_mcp_server.my_tool(arg="value")  # Call a tool exposed by the server

# --- STDIO Transport (most common) ---
# Server runs as a child process. Command + args launch the server.

# --- SSE Transport (alternative) ---
# Uncomment below to use SSE instead of stdio.
# Server must already be running at the specified URL.
